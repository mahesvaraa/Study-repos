# Сompression algorithm
Upon learning that DNA is not a random string, freshmen of the Bioinformatics Institute from the informatics group suggested using a compression algorithm that compresses repeated characters in a string.

Encoding is performed as follows:
s = 'aaaabbсaa' is converted into 'a4b2с1a2', that is, the groups of the same characters of the input string are replaced by the symbol and the number of its repetitions in this string.

Write a program, which reads the string, encodes it by this algorithm and outputs the encoded sequence. Encoding must be case sensitive.

**Sample Input 1:**
```
aaaabbcaa
```
**Sample Output 1:**
```
a4b2c1a2
```
**Sample Input 2:**
```
abc
```
**Sample Output 2:**
```
a1b1c1
```
# Solution
```
from itertools import groupby

print(*[i[1] + str(i[0]) for i in [(len(list(g)), k) for k, g in groupby(input())]], sep="")
```
