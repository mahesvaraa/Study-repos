# Multiplication table

When Paul studied at school, he memorized the multiplication table by rectangular blocks. For his practice it would be very nice to have a program, which outputs a block of the multiplication table.

Write a program, which gets four numbers a, b, c and d as input, each on its own line. The program should output a fragment of multiplication table for all numbers of the interval [a; b] by all numbers of the interval [c;d].

Numbers a, b, c and d are natural ones and do not exceed 10, a≤b, c≤d.

Follow the output format from the example, use '\t' (tab character) to separate elements inside the line. Adding a space instead of line break is performed by the "end" parameter of the print function:
```
print(x, end=" ")
```
Please output the numbers from the specified intervals themselves in the left column and the top row (as headers).

**Sample Input 1:**
```
7
10
5
6
```
**Sample Output 1:**
```
	5	6
7	35	42
8	40	48
9	45	54
10	50	60
```
**Sample Input 2:**
```
5
5
6
6
```
**Sample Output 2:**
```
	6
5	30
```
**Sample Input 3:**
```
1
3
2
4
```
**Sample Output 3:**
```
	2	3	4
1	2	3	4
2	4	6	8
3	6	9	12
```

# Solution
```
a, b, x, y = int(input()), int(input()), int(input()), int(input())
print(' ', *range(x, y + 1), sep='\t')
for j in range(a, b + 1):
    print(j, end='\t')
    for i in range(x, y + 1):
        print(i * j, end='\t')
    print()
```
