# Polygonal curve

Given N points on the plane. Find the (N-1)-components not self-intersecting open polygonal curve, passing through all these points.

Construct the polygonal curve in the order of increasing x-coordinate. If there are two points with the same x-coordinate, position earlier that point, which has the smaller y-coordinate.

Use heapsort to sort the points.

**Sample Input:**
```
4
0 0
1 1
1 0
0 1
```
**Sample Output:**
```
0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1
```
# Solution
```
a = int(input())
res = []
for i in range(a):
    res.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
for i in sorted(res):
    print(*i)
```
