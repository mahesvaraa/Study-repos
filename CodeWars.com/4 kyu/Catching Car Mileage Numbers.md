# Catching Car Mileage Numbers

https://www.codewars.com/kata/52c4dd683bfd3b434c000292

Let's make it so Bob never misses another interesting number. We've hacked into his car's computer, and we have a box
hooked up that reads mileage numbers. We've got a box glued to his dash that lights up yellow or green depending on
whether it receives a 1 or a 2 (respectively).

It's up to you, intrepid warrior, to glue the parts together. Write the function that parses the mileage number input,
and returns a 2 if the number is "interesting" (see below), a 1 if an interesting number occurs within the next two
miles, or a 0 if the number is not interesting.

**Note**: In Haskell, we use No, Almost and Yes instead of 0, 1 and 2.

**"Interesting" Numbers**
Interesting numbers are 3-or-more digit numbers that meet one or more of the following criteria:

* Any digit followed by all zeros: 100, 90000
* Every digit is the same number: 1111
* The digits are sequential, incementing†: 1234
* The digits are sequential, decrementing‡: 4321
* The digits are a palindrome: 1221 or 73837
* The digits match one of the values in the awesome_phrases array
* † For incrementing sequences, 0 should come after 9, and not before 1, as in 7890.
* ‡ For decrementing sequences, 0 should come after 1, and not before 9, as in 3210.

So, you should expect these inputs and outputs:

```python
# "boring" numbers
is_interesting(3, [1337, 256])    # 0
is_interesting(3236, [1337, 256]) # 0

# progress as we near an "interesting" number
is_interesting(11207, []) # 0
is_interesting(11208, []) # 0
is_interesting(11209, []) # 1
is_interesting(11210, []) # 1
is_interesting(11211, []) # 2

# nearing a provided "awesome phrase"
is_interesting(1335, [1337, 256]) # 1
is_interesting(1336, [1337, 256]) # 1
is_interesting(1337, [1337, 256]) # 2
```

**Error Checking**

* A number is only interesting if it is greater than 99!
* Input will always be an integer greater than 0, and less than 1,000,000,000.
* The awesomePhrases array will always be provided, and will always be an array, but may be empty. (Not everyone thinks
  numbers spell funny words...)
* You should only ever output 0, 1, or 2.

# Solution

```python
def is_interesting(number, awesome_phrases, key=None):
    number = str(number)
    if any([
        len(set(number)) == 1,
        number[0] != '0' and set(number[1:]) == {'0'},
        number == number[::-1],
        number in '1234567890',
        number in '9876543210',
        int(number) in awesome_phrases
    ]) and int(number) > 99:
        return 2

    elif key is not True and int(number) > 97 and any(
            (
                    is_interesting(int(number) + 2, awesome_phrases, True) == 2,
                    is_interesting(int(number) + 1, awesome_phrases, True) == 2
            )):
        return 1
    else:
        return 0
```
