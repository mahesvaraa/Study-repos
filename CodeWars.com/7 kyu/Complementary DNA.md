# Complementary DNA

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the
development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of
the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or
there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

Example: (input --> output)

```python

"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA"

```

# Solution

```python
def DNA_strand(dna):
    trans_table = str.maketrans({'A': 'T', 'G': 'C', 'C': 'G', 'T':'A'})
    dna = dna.translate(trans_table)
    return dna 
```
